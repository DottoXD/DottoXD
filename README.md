### Â» ðŸ‘‹ Hey there.

I'm a frontend/backend developer mainly using **TypeScript**, **Java** and **Go**.
I'm currently working on a few projects such as
- WycordJS, a free TypeScript Discord API wrapper.
- [Orangy](https://github.com/OrangyBot), an all in one and free Discord bot. 
- my own [Minecraft server](https://github.com/ShulkeredClub)
- ...and more!
